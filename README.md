# Car-Price-Data-Analysis<br>
Exploratory Data Analysis - Car Price Data<br>
In this repository, I have taken Car Price data from Kaggle and I have done:<br>
1. Data Integration:<br> Combining potentially multiple datasets (e.g., different car manufacturers or model years) into a single, cohesive dataset for unified analysis. This might involve merging datasets with separate information, like combining specifications and pricing.<br>
2. Data Cleaning:<br> Addressing data quality issues, such as correcting inconsistent entries (e.g., inconsistent naming conventions for car models or erroneous price values) to enhance data reliability.<br>
3. Missing Value Handling:<br> Employing strategies to handle missing values in the dataset. These strategies may include techniques like imputation (replacing missing values with calculated estimates, like the mean) or the removal of rows or columns with a significant number of missing values. This ensures the data is complete for analysis.<br>
4.Duplicate Removal:<br> Identifying and eliminating duplicate entries within the car price dataset. This helps to ensure that each car is represented only once in the analysis, preventing skewed results.<br>
5. Outlier Detection and Removal:<br> Detecting and removing outlier data points to mitigate the impact of extreme values (e.g., unusually high or low prices) on the analysis. Outlier detection methods might include visualizations like box plots and statistical measures like the Interquartile Range (IQR).<br>
6. Data Normalization/Scaling:<br> Applying normalization or scaling techniques to numerical features such as engine size, horsepower, or mileage. This is particularly useful for machine learning tasks (e.g., price prediction) as it ensures that no single feature dominates the analysis due to its scale. Common methods might include min-max scaling or standardization.<br>
7. Data Visualization:<br> Utilizing visualization techniques to reveal trends and relationships within the car price data. The notebook incorporates diverse visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to explore the distribution of prices, the relationships between car features (e.g., horsepower vs. price), and the identification of any patterns.<br>
